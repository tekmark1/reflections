How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

I was able to more easily spot where the differences were, because all that was shown were the differences. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would make it a lot easier to compare versions, instead of having to frequently save updates as different files.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros include better control of when a commit is created; cons include the fact that one might forget when to save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Some version control systems recognize that you are using that control system with files that interact, while other control systems understand that you want your files separate.
